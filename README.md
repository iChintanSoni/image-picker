# image-picker
Image Picker, a tiny Kotlin Android library that allows developers to implement image picking stuff, in merely 3 lines of code.

## Features
These 3 lines of code handles everything you for you:
* Storage Permission Model
* Writing File Provider
* Ability to choose image from Camera and Gallery
* Ability to choose images from other Document Providers like Google Photos, etc

## Gradle Dependency
*Step 1.* Add the JitPack repository to your build file
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
  ```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        …
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
  ```

*Step 2.* Add the dependency
  ```groovy
	dependencies {
	    implementation 'com.github.iChintanSoni:image-picker:2.0.0-alpha01'
	}
  ```
## Usage

#### Get image in your Activity/Fragment:
```kotlin
val imagePicker = ImagePicker()
imagePicker.getImage(this) {
    getBitmap() // Image as Bitmap
    getFile() // Image as File
    getUri() // Image as Uri
}.onFailure {
    // something went wrong!
}
```

#### Changing default configurations:

Method: 1
```kotlin
private val imagePicker = ImagePicker {
    rationaleText = "This is custom rationale text"
    blockedText = "This is custom permission blocked text"
}
```

Method: 2
```kotlin
imagePicker.configure {
    rationaleText = "This is custom rationale text"
    blockedText = "This is custom permission blocked text"
}
```
